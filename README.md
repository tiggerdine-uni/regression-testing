# Regression Testing

A solution to the problem of identifying the optimal order in which a subset of tests should be run to find the most faults in the shortest time. We implemented genetic and hill climbing algorithms and applied them to two fault matrix datasets, [smallfaultmatrix.txt](https://github.com/tiggerdine/regression-testing/blob/master/python/smallfaultmatrix.txt) and [bigfaultmatrix.txt](https://github.com/tiggerdine/regression-testing/blob/master/python/bigfaultmatrix.txt).

See the report, [report.pdf](https://github.com/tiggerdine/regression-testing/blob/master/report.pdf), for:
 - a short overview of the problem
 - details on the key aspects of the implementation
 - the results of applying the developed algorithms to the problem
